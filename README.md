\\!/ WARNING \\!/ YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

Groups are now collections. If you want to have a collision group, just make a new collection and link your collision meshes to that collection. For instance:

![LOS collision](https://bansheerubber.com/i/f/YyseE.png)

Constitutes a valid LOS collision collection.

![Normal collision](https://bansheerubber.com/i/f/GRLrn.png)

Constitutes a valid normal collision collection. The same principle applies to detail groups. A collection named detail9999 will have all of its objects only visible in first person.

I don't think there's any other differences. GO MAKE THINGS!!!!!!!
